# [IN PROGRESS]

# Stitch Cal – A little stitch calc playground 📏

Just felt like playing around with some knitting calculations using React.

Used as a playground, possibly for some future tool to calculate even increases/decreases across rows in knitting (my favourite website for this just went offline and is nowhere to be found on archive.org).

> [!NOTE]
> This is just a one-evening quick-and-dirty play project, far from finished or perfect, but possibly something to experiment with some more in the future.
> After all, what’s the use in being able to code if you can’t create your own tools?

### Experimented with:

- **Stitch Clicker:** graphic version – distribute the decreases by hand, see everything in one row
- **Stitch Player:** descriptive version – Adds the decreases automatically, even distribution still pending
- **Calculator:** just your standard inc/dec calculations without a written result yet

Also, if you have any insights into the fine art of balanced knitting decrease calculations (and I mean _real_ even – that k1 on each side is a non-negotiable), we should talk and become best friends [on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fraulueneburg/)\
