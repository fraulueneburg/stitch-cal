# [IN PROGRESS] Stitch Cal – A little stitch calc playground 📏

Just felt like playing around with some knitting calculations using React.

Used as a playground, possibly for some future tool to calculate even increases/decreases across rows in knitting (my favourite website for this just went offline and is nowhere to be found on archive.org).

This is just a one-evening quick-and-dirty play project, far from finished or perfect, but possibly something to experiment with some more in the future.
After all, what’s the use in being able to code if you can’t create your own tools?

Also, if you have any insights into the fine art of balanced knitting decrease calculations (and I mean _real_ even – with a k1 on each side), we should talk and become best friends [on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fraulueneburg/)

Used Vite for the setup.
